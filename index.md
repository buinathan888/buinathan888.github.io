# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Nathan Bui and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was my favorite lab.  I have played many different card 
    games over the years, and blackjack is one of my favorites (second behind
    texas hold-em)  I have also coded a similar program in Java, and it was
    interesting to see the differences that existed in C++.  Not only that,
    but my partner in the lab, Steven Bui, was simlarly interested and we 
    worked together well to complete the lab.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, parts 1 and 2, were the most challenging and interesting labs for
    me.  Having experience coding Java, I was familiar with many of the
    commands and scenarios of the lab assignments.  However, the ifstream
    command was new to me, and it was very fun to learn and use effectively.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, parts 1 and 2, was, I believe, the most cumulative combination of
    the elements we learned in this semester.  From the initial variable
    creation techniques to loops to reading files, this lab contained very
    interesting combinations to complete and test my knowledge.  This 
    combination made this lab fairly challenging and fun to code.

### Closing Remarks

* Future Journey

    Though this class was very fun, it is only the start of my Computer Science
    journey.  I am very excited to see what lies ahead, and what new languages
    and implementations I will learn in this class.  Thank you for your time and
    support throughout this semester, and I hope that this journey will continue
    forevermore.
